This repository contains some techniques to utilize huge amount of unlabeled corpus available for tasks such as sentiment classification to improve final accuracy of the trained network on test data.

# [1]. Learning to learn from weak supervision
A meta-learning setup to utitlize a huge corpus of unlabeled data for target task. An implementation based on [Learning to learn from weak supervision by full supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11383).
